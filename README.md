### Components

#### 1. Client-Side Encryption Module
- Encrypts premiums, risk parameters, and policy data  
- Ensures sensitive information never leaves the user’s device  

#### 2. FHE Evaluation Engine
- Computes aggregate risk and claim outcomes directly on encrypted data  
- Supports multi-member pools without revealing individual contributions  

#### 3. Decentralized Pool Management
- Smart contracts manage pool creation, contributions, and payouts  
- Provides transparent and verifiable governance
